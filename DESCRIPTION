Description: In psychology, many different guidelines exist for
    developing measurement instruments and manipulations of constructs, and
    different theories and empirical investigations often use different
    definitions for constructs with the same name. When conducting empirical
    research or secondary research, therefore, it is important to have a clear
    idea, and clearly communicate, which definitions are used, and which
    guidelines for developing measurement instruments and coding qualitative
    data are followed. However, because no standard exists for documenting
    this information in a systametic manner, these guidelines
    are fragmented, and no universal consensus exists regarding how any
    construct must be measured or manipulated. Therefore, developing one
    'final' taxonomy is not feasible or even desirable. At the same time,
    it is important that people clearly communicate their 'study-specific
    taxonomy'. The `psyverse` package makes it possible to combine these two
    goals.

Description: In psychology, many different guidelines exist for
    developing measurement instruments and manipulations of constructs.
    When conducting empirical research or secondary research,
    therefore, it is important to have a clear idea, and clearly
    communicate, which guidelines are followed. However, these guidelines
    are fragmented, and no universal consensus exists regarding how any
    construct must be measured or manipulated. Therefore, developing one
    'final' taxonomy is not feasible or even desirable. At the same time,
    it is important that people clearly communicate their 'study-specific
    taxonomy'. The `dct` package makes it possible to combine these two
    goals.

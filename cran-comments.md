Update: in v0.2.4, fixed URLs in the Readme file, as well as one vignette, removed LazyData directive since the package doesn't include data, and prohibited two examples from being executed unless in an interactive session, as these use the viewer which leaves "calibre-related detritus" in the temporary directory.

This is a relatively small update, but it includes some enhancements of the DCT standard and functions to import from spreadsheets. It also added a number of suggested packages to work with spreadsheets.

Update: in v0.2.1, fixed URLs in the Readme file, as well as one vignette, and removed LazyData directive since the package doesn't include data.

This is a relatively small update, but it includes some enhancements of the DCT standard and functions to import from spreadsheets. It also added a number of suggested packages to work with spreadsheets.
